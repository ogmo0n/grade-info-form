# Grade Info Form

Instructions:
Create a program that stores student grades in a text file. The file should contain the name, ID number, class taken and grade of every student. When the save as button is pushed, the selected text file is opened for writing. When each set of data is entered, the enter button is pressed to store the data in the file. When the load button is pressed, allow the user to load a grade file and display its contents in a read-only TextBox.

The entries should be displayed in the following format:

LastName, FirstName: ID# Class Grade (Figure 1)

We list some sample data below:

	Jones, Bob: 1 "Introduction to Computer Science" "A-"

	Johnson, Sarah: 2 "Data Structures" "B+"
